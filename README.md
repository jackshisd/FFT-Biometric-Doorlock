# Organic Signal Transmission via Fourier Analysis
Transmitting Data Through Organic Matter Using FFT + ESP32

## Overview
This project explores the feasibility of transmitting and decoding signals through organic matter using frequency-domain analysis with the ESP32 WROVER. The goal was to create a system that could reliably generate and detect analog signals‚Äîeven in the presence of noise‚Äîby leveraging Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and clever signal processing.

The concept was inspired by bioelectric impedance and the natural capacitive properties of high-water-content organic material.

Here is a picture of the FFT signal recognition device receiving a signal through a radish.  
The detected frequency can be used along with multimeter measurements to calculate the **impedance of the radish and other vegetables**.

- Various Vegetables (e.g., cucumber, bell pepper, spinach)

## System Architecture
### Signal Loop
Signal Generation: The ESP32 DAC outputs a sine wave at a set frequency.

Transmission: Signal passes through a test medium (vegetable/human body).

Acquisition: ADC reads the resulting waveform.

FFT Analysis: Frequency domain transformation detects signal frequency.

Action: Based on frequency, the system performs actions (e.g., LED blink, unlock logic).

### Sampling Strategy
Sample Rate: 2048 Hz

Sample Size: 2048 samples

Reason: Powers of 2 ensure FFT efficiency and accuracy, balancing processing time and memory usage.

### Experimental Results
Tested 7+ vegetables from the UCLA dining hall

- All supported AC signal transmission at 3.3V

- Voltage attenuation increased with frequency ‚Üí capacitive behavior

- Detected signals across human wrist and even opposite hands

- Caution: Human testing raises safety concerns due to current paths through the torso

## Technical Highlights
- 112% Gain Correction: Compensated for ADC hardware inaccuracies

- Nyquist Compliance: Max frequency = 1024 Hz for 2048 Hz sample rate

- Frequency Input: Controlled with buttons in ¬±10 Hz steps

- Visual Feedback: 7-segment display + bi-color LED

## Future Work
- Apply bioimpedance principles for health sensing (e.g., hydration, muscle mass)

- Expand to multi-frequency modulation for data encoding

- Explore other conductive organic and biological materials

- Implement wireless feedback or logging

## Code and Scripts
The code on this repository includes:

- Signal generation logic

- ADC capture + FFT implementation

- Sweep automation script

- Display and LED interface

## Disclaimer
This project involves low-voltage AC signals applied to living tissue. Do not attempt body-based transmission without understanding electrical safety and the associated risks.
